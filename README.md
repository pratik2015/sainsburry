Using best practice coding methods, build a Java console application that scrapes the Sainsbury’s grocery site’s - Berries, Cherries, Currants page and returns a JSON array of all the products on the page.

# Which html parser to use (jsoup/Jaunt)?
Ended up using jsoup parser.

# Description
1. This is built currently only for the link provided.
2. Presumption is that link will not change.
3. Json result is not ordered,this being limitation for JSON objects. 

# progress so far
Working code is ready.
Need to modularise the code.
